# Journalling-in-File-Systems
Operating Systems group assignment

Introduction
In the current fast-moving world of digital information, data integrity and system reliability
have become key concerns; hence, the role of journaling in file systems has taken great significance.
This paper expounds on how journaling has become a strong mechanism in enhancing data integrity
and recovery in modern file systems. In simple terms, it is a process whereby changes are pre-recorded
to files by the use of journals; hence, in case systems undergo crashes or abrupt shutdowns, they have
these transaction records that refer to recovery of consistency. The potential of this research does not
only dwell on how journaling works, the types of journaling methods available and the benefits over
non-journaling file systems, but also brings to light the pivotal role it plays in system performance and
minimization of data loss. Sections of this paper address how journaling works, a comparison with
non-journaling systems, applications of journaling in the real world, and its effects upon the
performance and overhead of systems. Journaling is once again underscored as an invaluable
contribution to the resiliency of digital infrastructure, in the context of protection means for data in
contemporary file system management.

TL;DR: This research assignment aims to investigate the role of File System Journaling in bettering and protecting data integrity
and aid in recovery in modern file systems.
